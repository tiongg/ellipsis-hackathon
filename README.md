```

## Seeding mock data

With the project running, run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:2000/admin/seed-mock-data
```

This will seed the stores and products. This only has to be ran once.

```bash
curl http://localhost:2000/admin/seed-listings
```

This will create 10 listings for all products. Run this when products are out of stock.
